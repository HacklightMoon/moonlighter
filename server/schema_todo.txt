If new tables or columns need to be created, put those here.

If there is a way to combine these two tables into one table called 'Quests', that'd be cool, but idk how to accomplish that because Projects and Issues require slightly different columns.

Projects table:
- Title (string)
- Description (long string)
- Tech Stack (array of strings?)
- URL (string)
- Possible columns?:
  - user_id foreign key

Issues table:
- Title (string)
- Github Username (string) [could we use this to match up with a user_id foreign key?]
- Body/Description (long string)
- Issue URL (string)
- Possible columns?:
  - user_id foreign key
  - Repo URL (string)
